          <h3>
            James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American
            singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer, and
            bandleader. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure
            of 20th-century music, he is often referred to by the honorific
            nicknames "Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", and "Soul Brother No.
            1". In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the
            development of several music genres.
